# Interfaces_Frases
This is code for Intel XDK platform, targeted to be android interfaces, showing the same functionality, but with different usability patterns.

##Functionality:
It shows a phrase on the TOP, with the 3 sections of a basic spanish phrase (Subject, verb, predicate), and a set of images below it that represents each segment, but divided into topics, so the user can create a phrase with them.

Screenshots provided on wiki page.

## Patterns covered:
* Navigational Drawer and Retractable Menu (*)
* Tabs
* Wizard
* One Window Drill Down
* Two Panel Select
* Responsive Enabling (**)


 *: Retractable menu has the same behavior of the nav. drawer, so it is a slightly mod. on the it's code, it was planned to just change the 3 bar icon with the name of the menu, but it's not implemented, just commented and refferenced a little bit.
 
 **: The responsive enabling doesn't show the blocking gray color to the second row, just the third, but it functions correctly.
